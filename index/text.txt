It might make more sense to display modules as shapes, each connected by lines to the modules which are imported. Or provide multiple visualizations of the project, each for a different purpose. 

Someone, sometime, and probably not all that long ago, came up with the canonical "project view on the left side of the window" design for IDEs. And you may wonder how that person arrived at that solution. After all, there were no prior IDEs to use for guidance. I think the answer is a basic one: because it's a solution that worked and was better than what came before. No magic. No in-depth comparison of a dozen possibilities. Clearly a way to see all the files in a project is better than a raw window in a text editor where there's no concept of "project" whatsoever. That solution wasn't the best solution that could ever exist in the entire future history of IDEs, but it sure fooled people into thinking it was. 

If you want to think like a pioneer, focus on the problem you're trying to solve. The actual problem. Don't jump directly to what everyone else is doing and then rephrase your problem in terms of that solution. In the IDE case, the problem is "How can I present a visual overview of a project," not "How can I write a tree viewer like in all other other IDEs I've ever seen
